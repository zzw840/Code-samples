% Rescaled Range Analysis - 

% Goal: To obtain the log scale of the rescaled range series of the SP500HF index for each time.

% Note: A is a list of SP500HF index in chronological order.
A = load('sp500hf.txt');

% B is the log return for the sp500hf index.
B = diff(log(A));

% The list for log of rescaled range is stored in list f.
f = 0;

% 91252 is the size of A (it is known)
for s = 1:91251
	c = mean(B(1:s));
clear x;
x = B(1:s) - c;
clear y;
	y = cumsum(x);

T = std(x,1);                     % Calculate the standard deviation
R = max(y) - min(y);              % Range series
f(s) = log(R/T);                  % Log of rescaled range.
